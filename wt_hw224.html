<h3>What exactly is AI?</h3>


<p style="color:Brown">
	<i>Definition - What does Artificial Intelligence (AI) mean? Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans.</i> <br>Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include: Speech recognition,Learning,Planning,Problem solving.<br>Knowledge engineering is a core part of AI research. Machines can often act and react like humans only if they have abundant information relating to the world. Artificial intelligence must have access to objects, categories, properties and relations between all of them to implement knowledge engineering.
</p>
<p style="color:DarkMagenta;"> Initiating common sense, reasoning and problem-solving power in machines is a difficult and tedious task.Machine learning is also a core part of AI.Learning without any kind of supervision requires an ability to identify patterns in streams of inputs, whereas learning with adequate supervision involves classification and numerical regressions.
