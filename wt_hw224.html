<h3>What exactly is AI?</h3>
<p style="color:Brown">
	<i>Definition - What does Artificial Intelligence (AI) mean? Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans.</i> <br>Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include: Speech recognition,Learning,Planning,Problem solving.<br>Knowledge engineering is a core part of AI research. Machines can often act and react like humans only if they have abundant information relating to the world. Artificial intelligence must have access to objects, categories, properties and relations between all of them to implement knowledge engineering.
</p>
<p style="color:DarkMagenta;"> Initiating common sense, reasoning and problem-solving power in machines is a difficult and tedious task.Machine learning is also a core part of AI.Learning without any kind of supervision requires an ability to identify patterns in streams of inputs, whereas learning with adequate supervision involves classification and numerical regressions.

Robots and Artificial Intelligence
<p style="color:DarkMagenta;"> Artificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the most exciting field in robotics. It's certainly the most controversial: Everybody agrees that a robot can work in an assembly line, but there's no consensus on whether a robot can ever be intelligent.
<br>
Like the term "robot" itself, artificial intelligence is hard to define. Ultimate AI would be a recreation of the human thought process -- a man-made machine with our intellectual abilities. This would include the ability to learn just about anything, the ability to reason, the ability to use language and the ability to formulate original ideas. Roboticists are nowhere near achieving this level of artificial intelligence, but they have made a lot of progress with more limited AI. Today's AI machines can replicate some specific elements of intellectual ability.
